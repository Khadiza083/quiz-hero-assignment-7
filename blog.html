    <!-- question 1 -->
    <h2>What is the difference between map, forEach and filter?</h2>
    <span><h3>Ans: </h3>Map returns an array. On the other hand, forEach returns undefined and filter checks every element of an array. If the condition is true then returns a new array.</span>
    <!-- question 2 -->
    <h2>What is the difference between localstorage, cookies and sectionStorage?</h2>
    <span><h3>Ans: </h3><p><b>Localstorage</b>: It expires never. That means, if the browser is closed then the data will not be deleted. Capacity is 10MB. </p><p><b>Cookies</b>: It remains manually set and limited to 4KB. Storage locations are Browser and Server.</p>
    <p><b>Sessionstorage</b>: It expires when the tab is closed. Capacity is 5MB. Storage location is browser only.</p></span>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h2>What is Event Loop?</h2>
    <span><h3>Ans: </h3> The event loop monitors the call stack and the task queue, and when the call stack is empty, it takes the first task from the task queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.</span>

    <!-- quizTimer function description -->
    <h2>Working of the function quizTimer.</h2>
    <span><h3>Ans: </h3>This is a JavaScript function called quizTimer that takes one parameter dismiss. It starts a timer that counts the number of seconds and displays it on the HTML element with ID "count".

        If the dismiss parameter is true, the function clears the timer and stops counting. Otherwise, the function continues to update the timer every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
        
        The timer uses the count variable, which is initially set to 0. Each time the timer updates, the function calculates the minutes and seconds from the count variable and displays them on the HTML element.
        
        If the count variable is greater than 60, the function toggles between two different text colors (text-red-300 and text-red-700) every second, using the modulus operator to determine whether the count is even or odd.</span>
    <!-- chooseQuize function description -->

    <h2>Working of the function chooseQuize.</h2>
    <span><h3>Ans: </h3>This is a JavaScript function called chooseQuiz that takes two parameters, index and givenAns. The purpose of this function is to store the selected answer for the given quiz question in an array called answers.

        The function first checks if there is already an object in the answers array with an id property that matches the current quiz question's id from the quizData array. If such an object exists, it means the user has already selected an answer for this question and the function needs to update the answer for this question.
        
        The function then loops through the answers array to find the matching object and updates the givenAns property of that object to the new selected answer. If there is no match, the function adds a new object to the answers array with the id and givenAns properties.
        
        Finally, the function calls another function displayAnswers and passes the answers array as an argument to update the UI with the user's selected answers for all questions.
        
        Note that this code assumes that there are two arrays quizData and answers that contain quiz questions and user-selected answers, respectively. Additionally, there should be a function displayAnswers that updates the UI with the selected answers for all questions.</span>
